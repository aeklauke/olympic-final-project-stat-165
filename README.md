**Stat 165 Final Project**

Project Summary:
We wanted to explore a question relevant to current events and sports, such as the Summer Olympics. With the growing popularity and coverage of gymnastics, we wanted to examine if there was a relationship between a country’s team gymnastics results and overall country “success” measured (via medal count). For reference, below is the resolution from the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.
